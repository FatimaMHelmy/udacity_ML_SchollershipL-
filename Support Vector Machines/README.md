**C:**  
 _The C parameter controls the relative weighting of classification error and margin error.  
 _Recall that large C means more focus is placed on classifying points correctly,      
 _whereas small C focuses more on establishing a large margin.
 
**kernel**:
 _The kernel. The most commonly-used ones are linear, poly, and rbf.
 
**degree**: 
 _If the kernel is polynomial, this is the max degree of the monomial terms.
 
**gamma**: 
 _If the kernel is rbf, this is the gamma parameter that controls how narrow or wide the “mountains” are. 
 _Larger gamma means “taller peaks” and a higher likelihood of overfitting
